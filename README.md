# Talking Points

- Formatting on board
  - Added spaces so that board was more clearly readable from side of terminal
  - Limitations without frontend?
    - Took liberties on formatting which impacted test readability and maybe convention in code? but made for better readibility during gameplay
- Line breaks and spacing for readability
- Scaling - methods in computer randomization will more easily scale to larger boards
  - Expand on all methods where we randomize
- Gets tests
-Buggy computer fire method (submarine placement bug).
-Turn class, can methods go in other classes?
